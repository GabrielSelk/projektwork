# **User Stories**

**As a** test automation student of Masterfield 
**I want** to automate some features of "https://go.bkk.hu/"
**so that** my project work is finished.

### Features
1. Cookie handling
2. Setting up route in Utazástervezés: Honnan (A), Hova (B), after that click on Tervezés button.
3. Asserting and testing out results in Lehetséges utvonalak.

### Acceptance Criteria 
1. I can click and accept the cookie pop-up and after it disappears, and doesn't pop up after I reload the page.
2. I can give valid inputs to textfield (A) and (B), and can click on (Tervezés) button after.
3. I can see (Assert existance off) the results, and click on given result, to trigger proper responce on the map.
